NodeRestfulAPI

Description
This is a restful api built with Nodejs and MongoDB as the database. For ease of using MongoDB, I have used MongoDB Atlas which is a free cloud hosted MongoDB.

How to use
- Clone the repo
- Signup for MongoDB atlas (Free), create a cluster, add an app and copy the connection string. You can as well use a local MongoDB instance
- Create .env file in the root of the application
- Copy the contents of .env.example file, paste in the .env file and replace the values with your own
- Run npm install
- If you have nodemon installed, run nodemon server.js else run node server.js
